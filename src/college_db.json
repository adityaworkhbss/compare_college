    "Review": "Reviews of IIM Visakhapatnam generally highlight its strong placement record, quality faculty, a growing reputation for industry engagement, and a positive learning environment, with many students praising the holistic development they experienced while studying there, particularly in terms of practical application and skill development; however, some might mention its relatively newer status compared to established IIMs as a potential factor to consider depending on individual priorities.",
    "Any Issue": "Some potential issues often cited regarding IIM Visakhapatnam include its relatively newer status as a \"baby IIM\" leading to possible limitations in faculty experience, a smaller alumni network compared to older IIMs, potential challenges with industry exposure due to its location in Visakhapatnam, and occasionally being perceived as having a slightly lower ranking compared to established IIMs in major cities; however, the institute is actively working to address these concerns by building its reputation, expanding research initiatives, and fostering strong industry connections",
