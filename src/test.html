                "Any Issue": " While MDI Gurgaon's online Executive MBA program is generally considered reputable, potential concerns could include: limited networking opportunities compared to a traditional on-campus program, less face-to-face interaction with faculty, and potential challenges with managing a demanding work schedule alongside online learning; however, the program is designed to mitigate these issues with structured online interactions and dedicated support for working professionals.",
